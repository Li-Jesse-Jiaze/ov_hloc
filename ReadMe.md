# OV_HLOC

Using **[Hierarchical-Localization](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization)** instead of DBoW2 for loop closure. This was originally part of my undergraduate final project, where I worked on improving the loop closure module of VINS-Fusion. I found it just right for providing a loosely coupled pose graph for **[OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins)**.

## Dependencies

* OpenVINS - https://docs.openvins.com/gs-installing.html

* Ceres Solver - https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver

* PyTorch and libtorch - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

  For libtorch, all you need to do is unzip it and fill the file path into `loop_fusion/CMakeLists.txt` line 13.

  ```cmake
  # set your own libtorch path
  set(TORCH_PATH */libtorch/share/cmake/Torch)
  ```

## Installation Commands


```shell
# setup our workspace
mkdir -p ~/workspace/catkin_ws_ov/src/
cd ~/workspace/catkin_ws_ov/src/
# repositories to clone
cd src
git clone https://github.com/rpng/open_vins.git
git clone https://github.com/Li-Jesse-Jiaze/ov_hloc.git
# go back to root and build
cd ..
catkin build -j4
```

## Download and Convert HF-Net

Download [SuperGluePretrainedNetwork/models/weights](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork/tree/master/models/weights) and place them in `support_files/Networks/weights`.

```shell
cd ~/workspace/catkin_ws_ov/src/ov_hloc/support_files/
python convert_model.py
```

## Run Example

```
roscore # term 0
roslaunch ov_msckf subscribe.launch config:=euroc_mav # term 2
roslaunch loop_fusion posegraph.launch # term 3
rviz # term 4
rosbag play V1_01_easy.bag # term 5
```

select `config/vins_rviz_config.rviz` as config in rviz

It runs well with VINS-Fusion, but the pose graph is not very smooth when I use it as a secondary node of OpenVINS on my laptop(RTX 2060 Max-Q 65W). This is mainly because my NetVLAD is using a VGG16 (it tooks more than 50ms for each frame ðŸ˜ ). It would be better to use a lighter network (e.g. Mobile Net) to describe the images for NetVLAD.

Here's a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/bv1KP4y1F73M) of it working with the VINS-Fusion.
